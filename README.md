# Family-based features categorization

This code uses Event-based features, extracted from seismicity catalog ba spatio-temporal windows, to construct Family-based features. In a further step, these families are categorited, revealing preparatory evolution of earthquake. This workflow is conducted for two case studies:
1. **Türkiye:** 2023 Mw 7.8 Kahramanmaraş. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sadeghkarimpouli/family_based_features/blob/main/Kahramanmaras_Family_clustering.ipynb)

2. **L'Aquila:** 2009 Mw 6.1 L'Aquila. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sadeghkarimpouli/family_based_features/blob/main/LAquila_Family_clustering.ipynb)
